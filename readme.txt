== Description ==
 
**Premium Monetizing System**

CODEC provides quality bloggers and publishers* with an additional revenue stream, as well as an increase in audience engagement. Monetize 100% of your traffic (CODEC is not blocked by any AdBlocks currently on the market) or use CODEC as a Fallback for your blocked ads to increase your current monetization by 40% on average.

**Enjoy:**
	- top monetization rates of $4-$12 CPM.
	- monthly payouts to your PayPal account, no minimum.
	- real human support. 

**Only Quality Content**

No obscenity, no violence, no video games. We 100% manually moderate CODEC content to ensure it's always family-friendly. Monetize your content without compromising your integrity as well as your users’ experience.

**Not Ad Blocked**

CODEC ads are not adblocked, allowing you to monetize up to 100% of your traffic.

**Your Readers Stay on Your Site**

Most monetization systems pay when your reader clicks on their headline, link or banner and leaves your site. You thus lose the hard-earned traffic. With CODEC, users don’t need to leave your site for you to earn. We pay CPM, which means every time a user sees the CODEC content on your site, you earn money.

**As Easy as 1-2-3**

It takes about 2 min to install and set up the plugin. Choose the location and the look of your widget. The rule of thumb is the bigger the widget you pick (6 unit plugin vs 3 unit plugin), the more revenue you’ll enjoy at the end of each month.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= How fast will my sponsored content appear? =
 
Sample content will appear immediately. 
Paid content will display within 24 hours, once your website is verified.
 
= How will I know that my website is verified? =
 
You will receive an email notification that your website is verified.

= What minimum traffic is required? =

No minimum. We know you work hard, and we want to support you.

= How much earnings can I expect? =

CODEC payments are usually higher than any banner network, recommendation (aka native) ads, etc. Moreover, CODEC ads are not adblocked, allowing you to monetize up to 100% of your traffic.

= I already have Ad banners on my site, can I still monetize with CODEC? =

Absolutely! Ad banners are not paying you every time a user with ad blockers enjoys content on your site. It's usually about 40% of traffic. CODEC content is not blocked by any current ad blockers.

You can use CODEC 1) in addition to your current source of monetization or 2) as a fallback where CODEC ads will be shown instead of banners or native ads when they are ad blocked.

= What is the best location to place the CODEC widget? =

For maximum monetization and the best user experience, place the widget right after the article (preset by default for you). It's not invasive to the reader, you get to keep your site’s premium placements at the top of the page for any existing sponsorship or banners while still earning a great deal with the CODEC Sponsored Content plugin.
